## About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This website was created using html, css and javascript to create a weather dashboard for travellers. You can enter any city and it will give you both current and 5 day forcast both including the date, temp, wind, and humidity. Each searched city is stored in localstorage and can be accessed again by clicking the city name. I have included an optional Country field since there are often multiple cities with the same name in different countries. (ie London, BG and London, CA)
